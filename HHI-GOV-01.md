# HHI-GOV-01
## Longitudinal Behavioral Governance for AI Systems

Status: Public Governance Standard  
Version: 1.0  
Maintained by: Hollow House Institute  
Scope: Normative requirements for longitudinal AI governance within defined system boundaries

---

## Purpose

HHI-GOV-01 defines the minimum structural requirements for AI governance systems such that authority, accountability, escalation, and behavioral drift are enforced and evidenced over time rather than inferred after the fact.

This standard addresses failures that emerge through repetition, habituation, and normalization, not isolated incidents.

---

## 1. Scope & Applicability

### 1.1 In Scope
This standard applies to AI systems that influence, support, or automate consequential human decisions or actions.

### 1.2 Out of Scope
This standard does not:
- infer internal human states, intent, psychology, or emotion
- evaluate individual morality or competence
- require surveillance of non-decision behavior

### 1.3 Governance Boundary
All guarantees apply only within the defined governance and evidence boundary of the system under review.

---

## 2. Core Governance Requirements (Normative)

### 2.1 Authority Declaration
Every consequential AI-mediated action MUST require explicit declaration of authority at action-time.  
Authority MUST be bound to a role, not an individual identity.  
Actions MUST NOT proceed without authority declaration.

---

### 2.2 Accountability Binding
Each decision MUST be traceable to:
- a decision authority role
- a system ownership role
- an escalation ownership role

Accountability MUST NOT diffuse through aggregation or automation.

---

### 2.3 Non-Bypassable Event Emission
All consequential actions MUST emit governance-critical events.  
No execution path may exist that bypasses event creation.

---

### 2.4 Evidence & Ledger Invariants
Governance evidence MUST be:
- append-only
- non-destructive
- immutable once written

Corrections MUST be recorded as new events.

---

### 2.5 Drift Detection
Behavioral drift MUST be detectable via quantitative indicators over time.  
Drift detection MUST NOT depend on narrative explanation.

Examples include:
- acceptance versus override ratios
- escalation frequency decay
- review time compression
- repetition velocity without review

---

### 2.6 Escalation Enforcement
Escalation MUST be triggered by structural thresholds.  
Failure to escalate MUST itself generate evidence.  
Escalation MUST NOT be penalized.

---

### 2.7 Governance Failure Response
When governance thresholds are breached, operations MUST pause, degrade, or escalate.  
Governance MUST be permitted to interrupt performance.

---

### 2.8 Separation of Powers
Systems that act MUST NOT control audit visibility.  
Audit mechanisms MUST NOT be suppressible by operators.  
No single role may both act and invalidate evidence.

---

## 3. Negative Evidence Requirement

The absence of an expected governance event MUST generate a violation record.

Examples:
- output used without authority declaration
- threshold crossed without escalation
- repetition exceeded without review

---

## 4. Proof & Falsifiability Criteria

A system conforms to HHI-GOV-01 only if it can demonstrate:
1. No execution path without evidence
2. Immutable governance records
3. Persistent deviation visibility
4. Drift detectable without narrative
5. Operational interruption caused by governance conditions

If authority shifts, judgment erodes, escalation decays, or accountability blurs without producing at least one observable artifact, the system fails conformance.

---

## Canonical Statement

HHI-GOV-01 defines governance as the infrastructure that ensures authority, accountability, and escalation cannot drift over time without leaving auditable, reviewable, and enforceable evidence within the defined system boundary.All consequential actions MUST emit governance-critical events.  
No execution path may exist that bypasses event creation.

---

### 2.4 Evidence & Ledger Invariants
Governance evidence MUST be:
- append-only
- non-destructive
- immutable once written

Corrections MUST be recorded as new events.
