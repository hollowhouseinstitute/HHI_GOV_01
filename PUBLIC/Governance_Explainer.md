# Governance Before Agents

Most system failures are not technical failures.
They are governance failures that emerge over time.

HHI_GOV_01 defines governance as infrastructure that preserves:
- Singular decision authority
- Escalation integrity
- Accountability over repeated use

## What This Is Not
- Not ethics guidance
- Not policy
- Not a point-in-time audit

## What Makes It Different
HHI_GOV_01 governs behavioral accumulation:
how repeated decisions harden into irreversible infrastructure.

## Core Principle
**Time turns behavior into infrastructure.**

This is why governance must precede autonomy.
