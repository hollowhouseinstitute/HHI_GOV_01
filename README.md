# HHI-GOV-01

HHI-GOV-01 is a public governance standard defining the minimum structural requirements for AI systems to prevent silent behavioral drift over time.

The standard treats governance as infrastructure rather than policy. It specifies enforceable requirements for authority declaration, accountability binding, non-bypassable evidence generation, numerical drift detection, escalation enforcement, and falsifiable proof criteria within defined system boundaries.

HHI-GOV-01 is intended for regulators, auditors, system designers, researchers, and organizations seeking verifiable governance rather than documentation-based compliance.

# HHI-GOV-01: The Stop-Power Doctrine

**Subtitle:** Who can stop an AI system—and why that authority must exist before deployment.

HHI-GOV-01 is a canonical governance doctrine defining the minimum authority required to prevent silent failure in AI systems operating over time.

This doctrine establishes that **if no actor holds explicit, enforceable stop power at runtime, the system is already ungoverned—regardless of outcomes.**

---

## Core Principle

**Time turns behavior into infrastructure.**  
**Behavior is the most honest data there is.**

---

## What This Doctrine Does

- Defines **stop power** as a non-delegable governance requirement
- Specifies **who may stop a system**
- Specifies **when a system must be stoppable**
- Explains **why policy, incentives, and review boards fail**
- Creates a citation anchor for audits, memos, boards, and regulators

---

## What This Doctrine Is Not

- Not an ethics framework
- Not a safety checklist
- Not alignment guidance
- Not a technical control specification

This is **authority infrastructure**.
